## 2026-01-22 - Departure Accessibility
**Learning:** Screen readers often mispronounce abbreviations like "min" as "minimum", making time strings confusing. Also, visual-only information like platform numbers in departure lists leaves blind users stranded without knowing where to go.
**Action:** Always provide full-word alternatives for time durations (e.g., "minutes") in accessibility labels and ensure all critical navigation data (like platform numbers) is included in the `.accessibilityLabel`.
